# AFK-bot

## What's The Point of AFK Bot
The point of this program is making sure my computer won't go to sleep for being AFK. Playing certain video games I would get kicked from the lobby for not moving but this has solved the problem. If I don't move the mouse for more than 5 seconds it will move my mouse around my screen randomly. The screen width and height will vary for each user. 

## Setup
You will need to install PyAutoGUI. You can do this by running:  python3 -m pip install pyautogui
